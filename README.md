# Harvesting data from website APIs with Python Requests

This repository contains slides (+pdf) and a detailed Jupyter notebook (+pdf) that demonstrate retrieving data from a REST API service using the Python Requests library. Data from the National Park Service Data API are used as an example dataset.

This talk was presented at the Smithsonian Institution Carpentries Brown Bag on 25 July 2019.
