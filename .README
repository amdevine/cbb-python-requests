# Harvesting data from web APIs with Python Requests

This repository contains slides and a Jupyter notebook that demonstrate retrieving data from a REST API service using the Python Requests library. Data from the National Park Service Data API are used as an example dataset.

This talk was presented at the Smithsonian Institution Carpentries Brown Bag on 25 July 2019.

Slides are available here: https://amdevine.github.io/cbb-python-requests/
